# Already Running an Kubernetes Cluster?

To use OpenEBS with your existing cluster, follow the install instructions under [Hyper-converged](../hyperconverged/README.md) or [Dedicated](../dedicated/README.md)

# Getting started

If you want to quickly get started and play with Kubernetes and OpenEBS on your laptop of ESX, you can jump down to our "Quickly Getting Started" Guide below.

If you are considering going into this at a bigger scale, you have a lot of options to pick from Kubernetes Official Documentation at [Kubernetes - Getting Started Guides] (https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/). With each passing day and ever rising popularity of Kubernetes, a new deployment mode gets added to the list. 

# Quickly Getting Started

Choose from the following depending on the machines at your disposal. If you are running an Ubuntu Host (either on laptop or through VMWare Player) that is VT enabled with sufficient RAM (8GB Free) and CPU (8 Cores Free) - use the Vagrant approach.
