Place-holder for providing the steps to run postgress clustered setup in K8s+OpenEBS. 

We hope to merge these files back to https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/blob/master/examples/kube/

Motivation

The k8s spec files are based on the files provided by [CrunchyData StatefulSet with Dynamic Provisioner](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers/tree/master/examples/kube/statefulset-dyn)
