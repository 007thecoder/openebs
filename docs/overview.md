#Introduction to OpenEBS?

OpenEBS is a storage platform, written in GoLang, to deliver persistent block storage for container eco system. The storage itself is containerized through a storage POD concept called VSM or "Virtual Storage Machine". VSMs are scheduled and managed using an orchestrator engine called "Maya". VSMs are fully isolated user space storage engines that present the block storage at the front end through iSCSI, NBD or TCMU protocol and consume raw storage from a local OpenEBS host or remote storage.

OpenEBS can scale to millions of VSMs seamlessly as it manages the metadata of the block storage system at a file level. The block storage for each VSM is managed as one single file or directory. The IO to this file is managed through large size chunks rather than the typical small size blocks. This enables to OpenEBS to provide higher performance for each VSM and to easilyh scale to very large number of VSMs.
