Setting Up OpenEBS -  Overview
==============================

OpenEBS can run on various platforms: from your laptop, to VMs on a cloud provider. OpenEBS can be setup as a single node or multi-node deployments.

OpenEBS runs on Google and Amazon Cloud providers and is tested on Ubuntu and CoreOS.
 
Users with existing data center infrastructure may prefer using on-premise or hybrid (data distributed between on-premise and cloud environments) solutions.
